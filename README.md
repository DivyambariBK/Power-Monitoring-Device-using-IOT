  - Power Consumption (P = Vrms √ó Irms √ó PF)

### 3. Data Display & Transmission
- Real-time data is shown on an LCD/OLED screen.
- Data is transmitted via **Wi-Fi** using **MQTT/HTTP** protocols.

### 4. Cloud & App Integration
- Data is sent to **Blynk App** or cloud dashboards for visualization and historical tracking.

### 5. Alerts & Notifications
- Users receive alerts on abnormal energy spikes or faults via mobile notifications.
